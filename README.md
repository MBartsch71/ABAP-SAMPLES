# ABAP SAMPLES
 Sample programming

This is a collection of some ABAP samples


## Explanation of functional ABAP
### Value expression
The VALUE expression in the new ABAP syntax is quite powerful. The following source code shows some examples along with the "old" way.

[YMBH_VALUE_EXAMPLES](/src/ymbh_value_examples.prog.abap)

### Filter expression
The FILTER expression is as well a very powerful way to extract information from an internal table. 
**Important:** The table from which the result is extracted (aka "the large table") need at least a sdorted or hashed key or is a sorted or hashed table.
